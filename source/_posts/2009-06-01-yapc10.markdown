I will be at <a href="http://yapc10.org/yn2009/">YAPC|10</a> in Pittsburgh the end of June.  Here's a schedule of the talks I plan to attend.  There are a few holes not because the talks at those time suck but because they rock so hard I can't decide which I want to attend.

Old Google Calendar embed removed.
