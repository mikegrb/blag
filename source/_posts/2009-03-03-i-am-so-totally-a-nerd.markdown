Somebody came into the IRC support channel for work and their nick was 'turtle'.  I made a logo joke and a co-worker corrected my short LOGO triangle.  This prompted me to waste 20 minutes in a LOGO interpreter.

```
RT 30
REPEAT 3 [REPEAT 3 [FD 100 RT 120] RT 120]
PENUP
FD 100
PENDOWN
RT 90
REPEAT 360 [FD 1.75 RT 1]
```

The output:
