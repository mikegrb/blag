I was standing outside smoking as the UPS guy rolled up for his thrice weekly visit (wife's home business), unfortunately I didn't see the topic of this post until we had finished a short chat and he went to the end of the street to turn around.  On the handle next to the driver's side door he had is trusty towel hanging so that it would be within easy reach wherever he went today.
