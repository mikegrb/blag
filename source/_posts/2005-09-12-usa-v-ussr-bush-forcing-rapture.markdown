Two very interesting pages courtesy of <a href="http://www.land-o-links.com/">Land-O-Links</a>.  The first a comparison of present day USA to the USSR.  The second a description of the work by the Project for a New American Century (PNAC), which includes Bush, Cheney, and Rice,  to force the rapture upon us by orchestrating world events to set up the conditions fundamentalist christians believe will lead to the rapture.<br /><br />
