Overheard at Dinner...

<blockquote>Yeah when I first moved here I  was out near that &lt;some plant&gt; on route 9, that place looked weird so I asked, "What is that, a nuclear power plant?" joking, of course.  But then they answered me, "No, the nuclear power plant is 2 miles further north".</blockquote>
