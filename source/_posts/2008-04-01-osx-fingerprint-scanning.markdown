Anybody know of some open source fingerprint scanning software for OS X?  Bonus points if it has magic integration with stuffs like the keychain, auto log-in, screen saver disable, etc.

Failing available open source software, what about commercial software?  I'm aware of software from upek that supports their <a href="http://www.upek.com/solutions/eikon/default.asp">Eikom</a> as well as ancient software from Sony for their Puppy scanner.  I'm looking for something that would support multiple scanners, ideally the U.are.U stuff.  Though if anybody wanted to trade a pair of USB U.are.U scanners for an Eikom one, that would be great too ;)
